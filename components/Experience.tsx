        <strong>QA Tester — Ardent World Inc.</strong>
        <br />
        <em>September 1, 2025 – December 4, 2025</em>
        <br />
        At Ardent World Inc., I worked as a Quality Assurance Tester,
        contributing to the delivery of reliable and user-focused software
        products. I was responsible for testing web-based systems, identifying
        bugs, and validating features against functional and business
        requirements prior to release.
      </p>

      <p>
        I conducted manual exploratory, regression, and functional testing
        across multiple user flows to ensure system stability and usability. I
        created and maintained test cases, documented defects with clear
        reproduction steps, and worked closely with developers to verify fixes
        and prevent regressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to QA work, I gained hands-on exposure to{" "}
        <strong>project management practices</strong> by helping improve bug
        tracking and issue workflows using <strong>JIRA</strong>. I assisted in
        organizing tickets, clarifying requirements, and ensuring issues were
        properly prioritized and tracked throughout the development cycle. This
        experience helped me better understand sprint planning, task ownership,
        and cross-team coordination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this role, I developed a strong appreciation for the full
        software development lifecycle—from planning and implementation to
        testing and delivery—while continuously improving both product quality
        and team efficiency.
