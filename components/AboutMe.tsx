      <p>
        Hi, I’m Jason Erwin Clyde V. Dimalanta — a developer driven by
        curiosity, problem-solving, and building things that actually work. I
        specialize in software, web, and machine learning development, with a
        strong focus on turning ideas into clean, functional, and scalable
        solutions. I enjoy working across the stack, learning new technologies
        quickly, and refining systems until they are both efficient and
        user-friendly. What sets me apart is my willingness to dive deep into
        problems, adapt fast, and continuously improve. I don’t just write code
        — I think about usability, performance, and long-term maintainability.
        Whether I’m building a web application, automating a process, or
        experimenting with machine learning models, I approach every project
        with ownership and attention to detail. I’m currently looking to grow
        with a team where I can contribute, learn from real-world challenges,
        and create meaningful impact through technology.
